# Optimal-Train-Trajectory-Platform-Project
This repository is dedicated to my end of year project as an artificial intelligence engineering student at ENSIAS
This project is a web platform that scraps the trains data from the local trains company (ONCF) dynamically, process this data to make the optimal trips combinations and display it in a user-friendly interface.
